# Lit Low-Level SDK

This is the low-level SDK for the Lit Node. It is used to interact with the Lit Node API. It is not recommended to use this SDK for end users. Instead, you should use the [Lit Rust SDK](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-rust-sdk) which is a higher-level SDK that includes this low-level one as a dependency, and is easier to use, with an API that closely matches the [Lit JS SDK API](https://naga.developer.litprotocol.com/sdk/introduction).
