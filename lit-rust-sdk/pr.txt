  - Guarded reqwest builder options on wasm and switched wasm crypto to the Rust backend to unblock wasm builds.
  - Introduced a shared PKP mint cache/lock helper and updated tests to reuse it for stability.

  Changelog: Wasm builds now succeed with a wasm‑safe HTTP client and Rust crypto backend, and e2e tests reuse a cached PKP mint to reduce nonce collisions without changing the public API.


 Example Usage

  // BEFORE
  let builder = reqwest::Client::builder()
      .pool_idle_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(10)))
      .tls_sni(false);

  // AFTER
  let builder = reqwest::Client::builder();
  #[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
  let builder = builder
      .pool_idle_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(10)))
      .tls_sni(false);
